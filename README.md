# The NEASQC BENCHMARK SUITE (TNBS) Library

This repository is associated to **The NEASQC BENCHMARK SUITE**, **TNBS**, of Work Package 3 of the NEASQC European project. As pointed out in deliverable **D3.5 The NEASQC Benchmark Suite**, each proposed Benchmark Test Case, **BTC**, must have an Atos myqlm compatible software implementation. This Github repository gathers all this code.

## Licence

The `LICENCE` file contains the default licence statement as specified in the proposal and partner agreement.

## Building and installing

The *requirements.txt* file contains the mandatory python libraries for using present libraries

## Repository organisation

The different **BTC** are located inside the **tnbs** folder:

1. *BTC_01_PL*: Software implementation for the **BTC** of the *Probability Loading kernel*. See deliverable: **T01: Benchmark for Probability Loading Algorithms**
2. *BTC_02_AE*: Software implementation for the **BTC** of the *Amplitude Estimation kernel*. See deliverable: **T02: Benchmark for Amplitude Estimation Algorithms**
3. *BTC_03_QPE*: Software implementation for the **BTC** of the *Quantum Amplitude Estimation kernel*. See deliverable: **T03: Benchmark for Phase Estimation Algorithms**
3. *BTC_04_PH*: Software implementation for the **BTC** of the *Parent Hamiltonian Kernel*. See deliverable: **T04: Benchmark for Parent Hamiltonian**
